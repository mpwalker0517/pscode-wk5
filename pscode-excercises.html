// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

x == input()
y == input()
	Sum == x+y
Echo(sum)


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Num == input()
	If num / 2
		Echo("even")
	Else
		Echo ("odd")

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a)  Num == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
b) Avg == sum(num)/5
	Echo (avg)
c)  Max == Echo(min(num))
	Min == Echo (max(num))
d) Echo "The average of the following entered numbers is ==Avg"
   Echo "The smallest number in the number set is ==Min while the largest number is ==Max"
